In order to make life easier for new players, the Rap Sheet Builder allows
users to print out Rap Sheets containing a summary of the Traits for a
Model or Character.

## Rap Sheet Objectives

Perhaps they are a bit overly-simplified, but my primary goals are the following:

* Speed - So that users do not have to wait for server communication,
    it should be fast and efficient. Favor processing on the device over the
    server where possible.
* Size - So that mobile users can find it useful, the tool should
    maintain as small a footprint as possible. This means less emphasis on
    images.
* Accurate - So that users can trust the tool, be as accurate in
    rules summary as possible.

As stated, these goals shape the development direction for the tool, and they
are certainly up for debate! You can contribute to the debate by [filling out a
Google survey here](#priorities-survey).

## Running Instance

The Rap Sheet Builder is currently deployed on Heroku here:

[https://sheltered-lake-26700.herokuapp.com/builder](https://sheltered-lake-26700.herokuapp.com/builder)

This is only a free Heroku deployment. If necessary to support the community, I
will upgrade it to a Hobbyist deployment. Shoot, it would probably be worth it
merely to get rid of that hideous link...

## Priorities Survey

I NEED your feedback in order to get better.

Feedback is immensely important in software. Interaction with users is what
makes the entire software world go round.

If you would like to help shape future development on the Rap Sheet Builder,
I have posted a Google Forms survey.

If you like the tool, take a minute and help shape my priorities.
